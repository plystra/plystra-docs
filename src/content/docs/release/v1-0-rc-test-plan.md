plystractl migrate up
plystractl migrate verify
```

### Expected Results

- All migrations apply.
- Migration status is recorded.
- Migration verification passes.
- Schema is ready for Core.

### Upgrade Database Steps

If previous release schema is available:

```bash
# Restore or initialize previous release schema

```bash
go generate ./ent
git diff --exit-code
```

### Expected Results

- Ent drift is zero.
- Generated code is up to date.
- Migrations match Ent schema.

### Failure Conditions

- Generated code changes after `go generate`.
- Migration diff appears after schema check.
- `plystractl ent check` reports drift.

Prove operational endpoints work.

### Steps

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ready

```

Canonical operational routes:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ready
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/version
```

### Expected Results

- `/health` returns service health.
- `/ready` checks database and migration readiness.
- `/version` returns version and schema information.
- Legacy paths remain compatible if promised.

### Objective

Prove `authz/check` and `authz/explain` work.

### Required Cases

#### Case 1: Allow Finance/APAC

Expected:

```text
decision = allow

Expected:

```text
decision = deny
deny_code = SCOPE_OUT_OF_BOUNDS
```

#### Case 3: Bob Shared Member Allow

Expected:

```text
decision = allow

actor_member_id = member_finance_reviewer
```

#### Case 4: Revoked UserMember Deny

Expected:

```text
decision = deny
