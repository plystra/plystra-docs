# Plystra v1.0 Readiness Checklist

## Document Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | Plystra |
| Version | v1.0 |
| Document Type | Release readiness checklist |
| Scope | Stable Self-Hosted Core |
| Status | Release Candidate gate |
| Owner | Core maintainers |

---

## 1. Purpose

This checklist defines the release gate for Plystra v1.0.

Plystra v1.0 is considered ready for Release Candidate only when every required item in this document is completed, verified, and documented.

The goal is not to add more product scope. The goal is to prove that the v1.0 Core is stable, self-hostable, testable, explainable, and safe to upgrade.

v1.0 focuses on:

```text
Stable Self-Hosted Core
Ent-backed Core schema
Core CRUD API
Resource Registry
Authorization check and explain
AuditLog
OpenAPI
Docker self-hosted baseline
Migration / drift / doctor tooling
Finance Reviewer demo cases
```

The following are not blocking v1.0:

```text
Console
SDK repositories
Plugin runtime
Plugin marketplace
Data Console
Template installer
Cloud hosting
Enterprise SSO
Advanced policy engine
```

---

## 2. Release Scope Freeze

Before cutting `v1.0.0-rc.1`, confirm that the v1.0 scope is frozen.

### Required

- [ ] No new feature scope is being added to v1.0.
- [ ] Console is treated as optional and non-blocking.
- [ ] SDK repos are treated as optional and non-blocking.
- [ ] Plugin metadata is treated as optional enhancement and non-blocking.
- [ ] Plugin runtime is deferred after v1.0.
- [ ] Data Console is deferred after v1.0.
- [ ] Cloud hosting is deferred after v1.0.
- [ ] v1.0 remains Core-focused.

### Acceptance Rule

If a proposed change does not directly improve one of the following, it must be deferred:

```text
Core schema stability
Authorization correctness
Audit trace correctness
Resource Registry correctness
Migration safety
Self-hosted baseline
OpenAPI/API contract correctness
Release documentation
```

---

## 3. Clean Clone Quickstart Gate

A clean clone must be able to run using only README instructions.

### Required

- [ ] A new developer can clone the repository.
- [ ] `.env.example` exists and is documented.
- [ ] README explains how to create `.env`.
- [ ] `docker compose up -d` starts required services.
- [ ] PostgreSQL becomes healthy.
- [ ] Plystra Core can be started locally.
- [ ] Migration command works.
- [ ] Demo seed command works.
- [ ] Doctor command works.
- [ ] Explain demo command works.
- [ ] README does not rely on undocumented local machine state.

### Required Commands

The README quickstart should cover the equivalent of:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plystra/plystra.git
cd plystra
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
plystractl migrate up
plystractl migrate verify
plystractl doctor
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/explain-demo
```

If commands differ, the README must reflect the actual commands.

### Acceptance Rule

A clean environment must be able to reach a working v1.0 demo without reading internal design documents.

---

## 4. Docker Self-Hosted Baseline Gate

v1.0 must provide a working self-hosted baseline.

### Required Files

- [ ] `Dockerfile`

- [ ] `postgres`

Optional services must not be required for v1.0 startup unless explicitly documented.

### Required Docker Compose Behavior

- [ ] `docker compose up -d` starts PostgreSQL.
- [ ] `docker compose up -d` starts Plystra Core if configured to do so.
- [ ] Environment variables are read from `.env`.
- [ ] Database connection settings work with the provided compose file.
- [ ] Container logs are readable.
- [ ] Container restart does not corrupt data.
- [ ] Volumes are named clearly.
- [ ] Production notes warn users about backup responsibility.

### Acceptance Rule

- [ ] Production `ent apply` is intentionally rejected and documented.

### Required Commands

```bash
plystractl migrate up
plystractl migrate verify
plystractl ent check
```

### Empty Database Test

- [ ] Start an empty PostgreSQL database.

```

### Acceptance Rule

plystractl doctor
```

And smoke tests must pass for:
